# Bus Tracking by ReatJs

**A react app to track the buses route**

* It has one college icon at the centre and 12 buses marked with their respective numbers on them.
* When we hover on the buse icons driver's name and number appears which makes it easier for the students to track their buses on their own.
* Also there is a start and destination point and stops set in between the route of the bus which gets highlighted when we click on it.
